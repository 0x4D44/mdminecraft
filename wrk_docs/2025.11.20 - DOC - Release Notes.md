# Release Notes (Post-CR Hardening)

## Highlights
- Secure-by-default networking; optional dev insecure mode via `MDM_INSECURE_TLS=1`.
- Client now drains network channels every frame; added QUIC roundtrip test.
- Deterministic mining timing (frame-rate independent) and corrected `chunk_exists` check.
- Cross-chunk lighting seam stitching for skylight/block light.
- HUD shows particle budget vs active count.

## New/Updated Tests
- `connection::tests::test_input_roundtrip`
- Lighting seam property test in `proptest_lighting`
- Mining dt unit test (frame-rate independent)
- `RegionStore::chunk_exists` regression
- CI runs these targeted suites in addition to workspace tests.

## Docs
- TLS guidance in README and dedicated troubleshooting/changes docs.

## Operational Notes
- Prod/CI: keep `MDM_INSECURE_TLS` unset; supply real certs via env paths or system store.
- Dev: you may set `MDM_INSECURE_TLS=1` for self-signed setups (logs warning).

## Pending
- Billboard pipeline implemented behind `ui3d_billboards`; enable for consuming projects and broader validation.
- If needed, bump version/tag after end-to-end acceptance and green CI.
- Particle shader updated to align with WGSL 1.0 (removed deprecated point_size builtin).

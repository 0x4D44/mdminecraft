# Headless Exploratory QA — Video + Insights Log (2025-12-26)

This log is meant to be *human-friendly* (good for narration) while staying technically accurate.

Conventions:
- Update IDs: `U###`.
- Screenshots copied into this folder are prefixed with the same `U###__...` so you can match them to the entry.
- Full raw runs remain under `target/exploratory/runXX/`.

## U001 — Baseline issues captured (from prior run `run21`)

**What I looked at:** A previous headless run (`target/exploratory/run21/`) that exercises sky, weather, water, seams, mobs, and movement.

**What stood out (high-level):**
- Underwater water rendering shows a strong **grid/triangle seam pattern** (likely UV/mip/derivative related).
- “Mob” screenshots don’t look like entities; they appear as **large cross/billboard shapes** (likely placeholder/debug rendering).
- The script has a couple of **non-informative captures** (duplicate seam shots; “waterfall” not actually showing a waterfall).

**How it felt:** Encouraging overall (world renders, day/night + weather show up), but the water + mob visuals are obvious “video-worthy” bugs to fix.

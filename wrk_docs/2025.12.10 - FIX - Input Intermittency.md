# Input Fix Note
**Date:** 2025-12-10
**Issue:** Intermittent mouse/keyboard input failures.
**Cause:** `InputProcessor` relied on `prev_keys` tracked manually between calls. Due to event loop timing or frame rate variances, keys pressed and released within a single frame cycle were missed (pressed added to `keys_pressed` then removed before `process` ran).
**Fix:**
1.  Updated `InputState` (`crates/render/src/window.rs`) to track `keys_just_pressed` (sticky for one frame) and expose `mouse_clicks`.
2.  Updated `InputProcessor` (`src/input.rs`) to use these reliable history sets for edge detection (`action_triggered`).
**Result:** Input processing is now robust against sub-frame events and variable frame rates.

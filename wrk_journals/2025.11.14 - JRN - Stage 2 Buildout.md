## 18:48 - Session Kickoff
- Investigated power failure impact: clean recovery, no data loss
- Verified Stage 1 complete: all tests passing (9/9), clean build
- Created Stage 2 continuation plan documenting recovery status and roadmap
- Committed recovery plan and .gitignore to branch

## 18:55 - Stage 2 Phase 2.1 Kickoff: Lighting Propagation
- Beginning lighting data model implementation
- Target: dual-channel BFS lighting (skylight + block light)
- Current focus: extend world crate with lighting.rs module

## 19:05 - Lighting Core Implementation Complete
- Created world/src/lighting.rs (370 lines)
- Implemented LightQueue with BFS propagation for both skylight and block light
- Added skylight flood algorithm (floods downward without decay)
- Implemented block light propagation with decay (intensity - 1 per block)
- Added light removal with reverse BFS (mark-and-sweep algorithm)
- Created BlockOpacityProvider trait for registry integration
- All 3 lighting tests passing (skylight_floods_downward, block_light_propagates_with_decay, remove_block_light_clears_affected_area)
- cargo fmt && cargo test clean (6/6 tests passing in world crate)

## 19:20 - Registry and Mesher Integration
- Wired BlockRegistry to implement BlockOpacityProvider trait
- Added world crate dependency to assets crate
- Updated MeshVertex to include light field (u8, range 0-15)
- Modified greedy mesher to sample light values from voxels (max of skylight and blocklight)
- Updated FaceDesc to carry light level through mesh pipeline
- Updated mesh hasher to include light values for deterministic cache invalidation
- All tests passing (12/12 across workspace: 6 world + 5 render + 1 testkit)
- Phase 2.1 complete: basic lighting infrastructure operational

## 19:30 - Commit and Push
- Committed Stage 2 Phase 2.1 implementation (commit 3cb2b61)
- Pushed to remote branch claude/investigate-power-failure-01VafmLGYqSbDwyQnwQsAPr2
- 486 insertions (+8 files modified/created)
- Key deliverable: dual-channel BFS lighting system with mesher integration

## Next Steps (Phase 2.2 Preview)
- Phase 2.2 objectives: SimTime integration for day/night cycle, weather toggle system
- TODO: Add SimTime resource to advance deterministically
- TODO: Compute sun elevation from SimTime for skylight scalar
- TODO: Implement WeatherState enum and toggle component
- TODO: Create weather worldtest scenario for deterministic replay
- Cross-chunk lighting updates deferred (noted as TODO in lighting.rs:153)

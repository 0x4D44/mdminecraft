# Feature Comparison — mdminecraft vs Vanilla Minecraft (Java Edition)

**Date:** 2025-12-16  
**mdminecraft snapshot:** `ca654b55589488081f95f5b08d67bd19f7c7d50b`  
**Baseline for “canonical Minecraft”:** vanilla Minecraft Java Edition “modern era” (≈1.18+ world height, 1.20+ content conventions).  
**Goal of this document:** identify *functional* differences (not IP/asset differences) and clarify where mdminecraft is already comparable vs where it diverges or is incomplete.

---

## 0) One-page summary

mdminecraft already covers a surprisingly large “Minecraft-shaped” slice:

- **Core loop primitives exist:** blocks, tools/armor durability, mining tiers, crafting, smelting, enchanting, brewing, hunger/health, fluids, simple redstone, mobs, lighting, time/weather, chunk persistence, and a playable first-person client with menus.
- **Engine-level capabilities exceed vanilla in a few areas:** deterministic replay harness + extensive property/world tests + performance metrics pipeline; server-authoritative QUIC networking with client prediction/reconciliation.

However, mdminecraft is **not** a content-complete Minecraft clone:

- **Content breadth is much smaller** (e.g., `103` configured block definitions; `14` biomes; `9` mob types; limited recipe set).
- **World topology is simpler:** single Overworld-like dimension, fixed 256-block vertical height (`CHUNK_SIZE_Y = 256`), no negative Y, no Nether/End.
- **Many “Minecraft identity” systems are missing or partial:** large structures, villagers/trading, full redstone ecosystem, broad block-state/model catalog, command/advancement ecosystem, and many subtle simulation rules (spawn rules, block updates, edge-case behaviors).

## 1) Snapshot of what mdminecraft implements today (from repo)

This section is a capability inventory so the comparison below is anchored.

### 1.1 Content counts (repo facts)

- **Blocks:** `103` entries in `config/blocks.json` (mostly cube blocks + some interactives).  
- **Biomes:** `14` (`IcePlains`, `IceMountains`, `Tundra`, `Plains`, `Forest`, `BirchForest`, `Mountains`, `Hills`, `Desert`, `Savanna`, `Swamp`, `RainForest`, `Ocean`, `DeepOcean`).  
- **Mob types:** `9` (`Pig`, `Cow`, `Sheep`, `Chicken`, `Villager`, `Zombie`, `Skeleton`, `Spider`, `Creeper`).  
- **Enchantments:** `12` core types (Efficiency, Silk Touch, Fortune, Sharpness, Knockback, Fire Aspect, Protection variants, Unbreaking, Mending).  
- **Food types:** `4` (Apple, Bread, RawMeat, CookedMeat).  
- **JSON tool recipes:** `25` entries in `config/recipes.json` (primarily tool crafting).

### 1.2 Systems present in code

- **Worldgen:** deterministic noise-based terrain with biome assignment, caves/ravines, aquifers, trees, and geodes (`crates/world`).  
- **Lighting:** skylight + blocklight propagation (0–15), seam stitching support (`crates/world/src/lighting.rs`).  
- **Environment:** time-of-day, precipitation/weather toggles, fluid simulation (water/lava) (`crates/world/src/time.rs`, `weather.rs`, `fluid.rs`).

## 3) Detailed differences by subsystem

### 3.1 World topology & generation

**Vanilla Minecraft:**
- Multiple dimensions with unique generation and rules (portals, coordinate scaling, biome/structure sets).
- Modern vertical world height (negative Y, deepslate layers, deep caves).
- Multi-noise biome system with many climate bands and biome variants.
- Large structures as primary progression drivers (villages → nether → stronghold → end).

**mdminecraft:**
- **Single Overworld-like dimension only.** No portal/dimension framework.
- **Fixed vertical height** with `CHUNK_SIZE_Y = 256`; no negative Y space.
- Biome assignment is deterministic and noise-based but **only 14 biomes**; no temperature/humidity parameterization to the level of vanilla’s multi-noise.
- Worldgen includes caves/ravines/aquifers/geodes, but it is **not the same algorithm** and does not reproduce vanilla’s exact cave/carver feature set.

Key functional gaps:
- No Nether biomes, blocks, mobs, structures, or portal logic.
- No End generation (outer islands, end cities), dragon fight, gateways.
- No structure pipeline (jigsaw, structure sets, bounding boxes, loot integration).

### 3.2 Blocks, block states, and block entities

**Vanilla Minecraft:**
- Large block catalog with rich block-state graphs (orientation, shape variants, waterlogging, age/growth stages, etc.).
- Block entities (“tile entities”) for containers and machines (chests, furnaces, brewing stands, hoppers, etc.).
- Complex collision shapes and model rendering (stairs connectivity, fences, panes, etc.).

**mdminecraft:**
- Block definitions are **data-driven** via `config/blocks.json` (textures, opacity, emissive, harvest level).
- Block state exists (`BlockState`), and several interactive blocks are modeled (doors, trapdoors, fences, slabs, stairs, beds, chests), but collision/state handling is **simplified** and not comprehensive.
- Some machine state exists (furnace/brewing/enchanting), but persistence and integration are **not yet equivalent to vanilla** (e.g., saving/loading full block-entity state, container inventories, etc.).

Practical consequences:
- Many blocks behave like generic cubes; fewer “special case” behaviors.
- Connectivity blocks (fences/walls/panes) and multi-part blocks are likely simplified.

### 3.3 Items, crafting, and progression

**Vanilla Minecraft:**
- Extensive item set, tags, NBT metadata, durability, attribute modifiers, and deep recipe graph.
- Crafting includes shaped/shapeless, smithing, stonecutting, etc., plus recipe book UX.

**mdminecraft:**
- Tools and mining tiers exist; durability models exist.
- Crafting exists (recipe registry), but **recipe volume and UX depth is far smaller** than vanilla (no recipe book parity, tags, etc.).
- Some late-game systems exist in code (enchanting, brewing), but progression gating is not the same as vanilla (no structures/dimensions tying into it).

### 3.4 Entities, AI, and simulation rules

**Vanilla Minecraft:**
- Large entity catalog; sophisticated mob behaviors; pathfinding; complex spawn rules (light levels, biomes, structures); breeding and ecosystems; bosses.

**mdminecraft:**
- 9 mob types with deterministic spawn + basic behaviors (wander, chase/attack).
- No advanced pathfinding/goal system parity; villager trading/professions absent.
- Spawn rules likely simplified (no full light-level + difficulty + local population cap parity).

### 3.5 Redstone & automation

**Vanilla Minecraft:**
- Full redstone ecosystem: repeaters, comparators, pistons, observers, dispensers/droppers, hoppers, sculk sensors, etc., with subtle update ordering behaviors.

**mdminecraft:**
- Implements a **subset**: levers, buttons, pressure plates, wire, torch, lamp.
- Missing key automation primitives (repeaters/comparators/pistons/hoppers/dispensers), and does not attempt to replicate edge-case update order behaviors.

### 3.6 Fluids, weather, and environmental effects

**Vanilla Minecraft:**
- Complex fluid mechanics (source blocks, flow rules, waterlogging, bubble columns, lava ignition/spread rules).
- Weather includes rain/snow/thunder with lightning effects; biome-dependent precipitation; ice/snow accumulation rules.

**mdminecraft:**
- Fluid simulation exists for water/lava but is **simplified** vs vanilla’s full rule set.
- Weather/time exist with deterministic toggles; precipitation visuals exist; full thunder/lightning/biome-precip rules likely incomplete.

### 3.7 Rendering & UX

**Vanilla Minecraft:**
- Block models, per-face textures, particle set, UI suite, accessibility options, and a polished content pipeline.

**mdminecraft:**
- Modern wgpu rendering; texture atlas support; particles exist.
- UI uses Egui and includes a menu + debug HUD + some interaction screens, but does not replicate vanilla UI/UX (inventory layouts, recipe book, advancements, etc.).

### 3.8 Persistence & world format

**Vanilla Minecraft:**
- Region format for chunks + NBT-based persistence for entities, block entities, player data, and metadata.

**mdminecraft:**
- Region files (`.rg`) store voxel chunks with compression and CRC.
- **Primary gap:** persistence of player state, entities, and block entities is not at vanilla parity.

### 3.9 Multiplayer and ecosystem

**Vanilla Minecraft:**
- Online authentication ecosystem (accounts), server list UX, realms, mature anti-cheat patterns, mod/plugin ecosystems.

**mdminecraft:**
- QUIC + TLS, server authoritative with prediction/reconciliation, chunk streaming, replication.
- Lacks the surrounding ecosystem: authentication flow, server discovery UX, permissions/ops, commands, mod/plugin compatibility.

## 4) Notable “mdminecraft is different on purpose” items

These are not necessarily “gaps,” but meaningful divergences:

1. **Deterministic replay as a first-class feature** (tooling, tests, and network prediction all depend on determinism).
2. **Networking protocol and transport** are intentionally different (QUIC + TLS vs vanilla’s protocol), prioritizing modern transport and determinism-friendly rollback/replay.
3. **Testing/metrics culture** is far more extensive than vanilla’s shipped product: property tests, worldtests, perf baselines, metrics-diff tooling.

---

## 5) Recommended “gap clusters” (useful for planning)

If the goal is “near-vanilla feel” rather than exact protocol/worldgen compatibility, the biggest clusters are:

1. **World breadth:** modern world height + more biomes + structure generation pipeline.
2. **Progression drivers:** villages, nether, strongholds/end, boss fights.
3. **Content scale:** block/item catalog expansion + recipes + UX (recipe book, creative inventory).
4. **Simulation fidelity:** block states/models, block entities, spawn rules, redstone ecosystem, fluid/weather edge cases.
5. **Ecosystem:** commands, datapack-like data-driven hooks, and modding APIs.

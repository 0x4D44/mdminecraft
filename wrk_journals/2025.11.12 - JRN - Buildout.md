## 09:15 - Session Kickoff
- Reviewed latest instruction: continue work and maintain journal.
- Ensured wrk_journals folder exists and initialized today's log for ongoing updates.

## 09:25 - Stage 0 Kickoff
- Reviewed repo state (empty Rust workspace).
- Drafted plan: scaffold cargo workspace + lint config, stub testkit sinks, prep CI skeleton.

## 10:20 - Stage 0 scaffolding
- Created Cargo workspace with 11 crates + CLI, added deterministic core/testkit scaffolds.
- Added GH Actions CI, rustfmt config, deterministic coding handbook doc.
- Implemented smoke test + ran cargo fmt/test (all green).

## 10:30 - Cleanup
- Added repo-wide .gitignore to keep target/ artifacts out of git.

## 10:40 - Stage 1 planning
- Reviewed Stage 1 goals to focus on chunk storage, meshing skeleton, render wiring.

## 11:25 - Stage 1 progress
- Implemented chunk SoA structures + LRU storage with dirty flags for mesh/light tracking.
- Added greedy mesher + mesh hashing, wired CLI demo, documented coding handbook tie-ins.
- cargo fmt && cargo test successful after resolving serde + Pod issues.

## 11:35 - Chunk mesh cache plan
- Need render-side cache that remeshes only when dirty flags request it; CLI will exercise for smoke coverage.

## 11:50 - Mesh cache implemented
- Added render::ChunkMeshCache that remeshes chunks only when DirtyFlags::MESH set; CLI demo now flows through storage + cache.
- Added cache regression test; cargo fmt/test passing cleanly.

## 12:00 - Next tasks
- Need a minimal block registry (opaque flag) + chunk remesh walker consuming storage + cache.

## 12:30 - Registry + chunk mesher driver
- Added block registry scaffolding and wired mesher/cache to consult it for opacity.
- Built ChunkMeshDriver to walk storage, remesh dirty chunks, and log hashes; CLI demo now exercises driver.
- cargo fmt/test remain clean.

## 12:40 - Next objectives
- Need block pack loader -> registry, and mesh driver should record triangle counts per chunk for Stage 1 exit criteria.

## 13:00 - Metrics + pack loader
- Added block registry loader (file/string) plus chunk mesh driver now emits triangle counts + hashes for each dirty chunk.
- CLI demo exercises driver and logs chunk metrics; all tests still pass.

## 13:10 - Stage 1 finishing moves
- Need to wire JSON packs into tests and emit chunk mesh metrics into testkit outputs before closing Stage 1.

## 13:30 - Metrics integration
- Added MeshMetricSink + stats_to_metrics; CLI now writes chunk metrics JSON, and new tests cover registry + sink flows.
- cargo fmt/test clean.

## 13:45 - CLI + testkit wiring
- CLI now accepts --blocks JSON packs and writes mesh metrics via testkit sink; render driver gained stats_to_metrics + write_metrics_to_file.
- Added MeshMetricSink helper + tests; cargo fmt/test passing.

## 14:00 - CLI flags + metrics sink
- CLI supports --blocks and --mesh-metrics; render driver exposes write_metrics_to_file using MeshMetricSink.
- cargo fmt/test clean.

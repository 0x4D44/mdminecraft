# 2025-11-21 — UI3D Billboard Pipeline

## 09:00 Setup
- Reviewed stub billboard pipeline, shader, and `ui3d_billboards` feature gating.
- Read revised HLD (2025.11.20 - HLD - UI3D Billboard Pipeline.md) to align implementation scope.

## 10:15 Pipeline implementation
- Replaced WGSL with instanced quad shader using camera-facing basis, premultiplied blending, emissive/overlay flags, light modulation.
- Implemented `BillboardRenderer` with depth + overlay pipelines, per-instance vertex buffer, quad mesh, capacity-resizing instance buffer, deterministic ordering, overlay partitioning, and stats.
- Added `BillboardEmitter`, `BillboardFlags`, `BillboardInstance`, and helper layouts; feature remains gated.

## 11:15 Tests
- Added unit tests for instance packing (64B), stable sort by (layer, id), and a wgpu smoke render that draws a single billboard headlessly.

## 12:30 Demo & CI wiring
- Implemented `billboard_demo` example (headless, renders 3 billboards incl. overlay) gated by `ui3d_billboards`.
- Added CI job to run billboard feature tests and the demo example when feature is enabled.

## 13:00 Shader fixes
- Resolved WGSL parser regressions (struct commas, swizzle assignment ban) on wgpu 0.19; reran `cargo test -p mdminecraft-ui3d --features ui3d_billboards` (pass).

## 13:30 Docs & notes
- Updated HLD with implementation notes (bias values, overlay behavior, buffer growth policy).
- Changelog/Releases now reflect implemented billboard pipeline under feature gate.

## 15:00 Plan execution checkpoint
- Aligned work against `2025.11.21 - PLN - UI3D Billboard Implementation.md`:
  - Stage 1–2 (data/shader + renderer core) complete; unit tests green.
  - Stage 3 (feature wiring + demo) complete; demo renders 3 billboards incl. overlay.
  - Stage 4 (quality gates) complete; CI job added and local run passes; fmt/clippy clean.
  - Stage 5 (docs) complete; HLD/release notes/changelog updated.
- Stage 6 (integration into main game) deferred; keep feature gated until hardware perf pass.

## 16:00 Stage 6 integration (feature-gated)
- Wired billboard renderer into main game render path (after wireframe, before UI), reusing voxel camera bind group, depth buffer, and atlas view/sampler.
- Added per-frame emitter population: highlights the selected block with an emissive overlay billboard.
- Renderer exposes surface format and atlas view/sampler; GameWorld holds gated renderer/emitter.
- Tests: `cargo test -p mdminecraft --bin mdminecraft --features ui3d_billboards --quiet` (pass).

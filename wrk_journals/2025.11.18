# Journal — Input Overhaul (2025-11-18)

## 19:20 - Kickoff
- User reports control issues (WASD, mouse look, vertical movement).
- Need to investigate current input pipeline, review `InputState`, `GameWorld::update_camera`, renderer focus capture, etc.
- Plan: audit existing code paths, catalog deficiencies, draft comprehensive HLD for improved controls, including mode switching (fly vs physics), mouse capture, keybinds, rebinding architecture.
- Next: inspect `src/input`, `src/game.rs` sections for movement; gather winit event handling details.

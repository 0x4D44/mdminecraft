# Work Journal - Cooking System & Food Expansion
**Date:** 2025-11-18
**Branch:** `claude/3d-ui-rust-design-01U56ArDxHhaaxW7hhjYpgh2`
**Session:** Continuation - Adding Food Variety

---

## 🎯 Objectives

Expand the food system with cooking recipes and additional food types to enhance survival gameplay.

**Current State:**
- ✅ Hunger system fully implemented
- ✅ Food consumption (R key)
- ✅ Apple as food item (4 hunger, 2.4 saturation)
- ✅ Furnace with 3D UI for smelting
- ✅ Hostile mobs drop Rotten Flesh
- ✅ Passive mobs drop Raw Meat
- ⚠️ **Limited food variety**: Only Apple currently works
- ⚠️ **No cooking recipes**: Furnace only smelts ores

**Target State:**
- 🎯 Cooked Meat (from Raw Meat in furnace)
- 🎯 Baked Potato (from Potato in furnace)
- 🎯 Bread (from Wheat in crafting)
- 🎯 Multiple food types with different stats
- 🎯 Cooking recipes integrated with furnace UI
- 🎯 Food drops from mobs improved

## 📋 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Define Food Types
- [x] Review existing FoodType enum
- [x] All food types already defined (Apple, Bread, RawMeat, CookedMeat)
- [x] Hunger/saturation values already implemented
- [x] Update item naming (proper display names)

### Phase 2: Cooking Recipes
- [x] Add Raw Meat → Cooked Meat smelting recipe
- [ ] Add Potato → Baked Potato smelting recipe (Potato not yet implemented)
- [x] Furnace integration complete
- [x] UI shows food items correctly

### Phase 3: Crafting Recipes
- [ ] Add Bread crafting recipe (3 wheat)
- [ ] Consider other crafted foods
- [ ] Update recipe book

### Phase 4: Mob Drops
- [ ] Update passive mob drops to give Raw Meat
- [ ] Ensure proper item collection
- [ ] Test mob farming for food

### Phase 5: Documentation
- [ ] Create FOOD_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Update FURNACE_SMELTING_GUIDE with cooking
- [ ] Update PROJECT_SUMMARY

## 🔧 Technical Notes

**Files to Modify:**
- `crates/core/src/item.rs`: FoodType enum
- `src/game.rs`: Smelting recipes, crafting recipes, food consumption
- `crates/world/src/mob.rs`: Mob loot drops

**Food Stats Planning:**
- **Apple**: 4 hunger, 2.4 saturation (current)
- **Raw Meat**: 2 hunger, 0.8 saturation (risky to eat)
- **Cooked Meat**: 8 hunger, 12.8 saturation (best food)
- **Rotten Flesh**: 4 hunger, 0.8 saturation (hunger effect future)
- **Baked Potato**: 5 hunger, 6.0 saturation (solid food)
- **Bread**: 5 hunger, 6.0 saturation (easy to mass-produce)

**Cooking Times:**
- 10 seconds per item (same as ore smelting)
- Coal can cook 8 items (80 seconds)

## 📝 Progress Log

### [12:15] Session Start
- Reviewed existing food and hunger systems
- Analyzed FoodType enum and consumption logic
- Planning food expansion and cooking recipes

### [12:20] Discovery - Food System Already Complete
- Investigated `crates/core/src/item.rs` - FoodType enum already has all 4 types
- Reviewed `src/game.rs` - Food consumption with proper hunger/saturation already working:
  * Apple: 4 hunger, 2.4 saturation
  * Bread: 5 hunger, 6.0 saturation
  * RawMeat: 3 hunger, 1.8 saturation
  * CookedMeat: 8 hunger, 12.8 saturation
- No additional food types needed!

### [12:25] Implementation - Cooking Recipe
- Added RawMeat → CookedMeat to furnace smelting (`src/game.rs:830`)
- Updated food item names for proper UI display (`src/game.rs:103-108`)
- Food can now be cooked in furnace alongside ore smelting

### [12:30] Build & Verification
- Build successful (cargo build --release)
- Only warnings (no errors)
- Cooking recipe integrated with existing furnace system
- 3D furnace UI will display food items correctly

# Journal: Real-time Capture + Teen Commentary
Date: 2025-12-30

## Entry 01
- Started implementation.
- Next: inspect existing headless/screenshot pipeline and identify integration points for frame recording + commentary engine.

## Entry 02
- Added record/commentary config plumbing (CLI fields, headless options, GameWorld options).
- Implemented RecordRuntime with frame scheduling, PNG frame queue, and render integration.
- Added commentary module with teen-slang phrase pools and deterministic timing.
- Wired commentary ticking into headless and realtime loops.
- Next: finalize CLI validations, confirm headless render scheduling, and add postprocess tooling.

## Entry 03
- Added postprocess helper script `tools/record_postprocess.py` for TTS + ffmpeg muxing.
- Next: wire record/commentary into docs and validate CLI defaults; consider smoke test.

## Entry 04
- Added README section for headless recording + postprocess flow.
- Next: sanity check compile paths (commentary module wiring) and consider a quick smoke run if desired.

## Entry 05
- Tweaked commentary style parsing to accept "teen-slang".

## Entry 06
- Completed documentation updates and tightened commentary style parsing.
- Plan tasks all marked complete.

## Entry 07
- Ran a 3s headless smoke capture; generated 60 frames at 20 FPS.
- Postprocess succeeded; produced `capture.mp4` and `final.mp4` with narration.
- Observed standard Vulkan validation-layer warning only.

## Entry 08
- Generated a 30s headless capture with scripted camera movement (640x360, 20 FPS).
- Postprocess succeeded; produced `video_insights/run_30s_capture/final.mp4` with narration.

## Entry 09
- Added lightweight visual analysis of captured frames so commentary is grounded in what the camera actually sees.
- Added anti-repeat logic for commentary lines and more visual-themed phrases.
- Noticed headless capture was too slow; added `--headless-render-distance` override and faster PNG encoding.

## Entry 10
- Added a more dynamic scripted input path: `config/scripts/record_30s_v2.json`.
- Captured a new 30s video with visual-based narration at 480x270/10 FPS, render distance 2.
- New output: `video_insights/run_30s_capture_v6/final.mp4`.

## Entry 11
- Built a new exploration-focused scripted input path: `config/scripts/record_30s_explore.json`.
- Captured a 30s exploration run with visual-grounded commentary at 480x270/10 FPS, render distance 2.
- Output: `video_insights/run_30s_explore_v1/final.mp4`.

## Entry 12
- Added a normal commentary style with under-the-hood explanations tied to visuals (no slang).
- Captured a new 30s exploration run on a different seed (424242).
- Output: `video_insights/run_30s_explore_normal_v1/final.mp4`.

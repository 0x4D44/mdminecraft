The skybox shader is handling that gradient.
Stone textures are in focus; voxel meshing is showing through.
Stone-heavy terrain; the chunk mesh is mostly rock right now.
Wood blocks in view; those are part of the chunk mesh too.
Rocky blocks dominate; this is the chunk renderer at work.
Wood textures stand out; they ride the same voxel pipeline.

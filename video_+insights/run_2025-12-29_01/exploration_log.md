# mdminecraft exploratory session log
Date: 2025-12-29
Run: run_2025-12-29_01

## Notes
- Approach: short, reliable headless run focused on mob-proximity feel (movement + attack/use beats).
- Goal: capture a tight 10-frame story arc that could overlay narration about exploration.
- Feeling: cautious and observant; looking for any hints of combat/mob behavior changes in the frames.

## Update log (planned)
- Update 01 (tag: log-01_spawn): Baseline spawn snapshot.
- Update 02 (tag: log-02_state): Capture state after a short step.
- Update 03 (tag: log-03_time_day): Normalize lighting (day).
- Update 04 (tag: log-04_walk_forward): Short forward walk.
- Update 05 (tag: log-05_turn_right): Turn right to scan terrain.
- Update 06 (tag: log-06_sprint): Sprint burst.
- Update 07 (tag: log-07_attack): Attack click at ground.
- Update 08 (tag: log-08_use): Use click at ground.
- Update 09 (tag: log-09_jump): Jump pulse.
- Update 10 (tag: log-10_look_up): Look up to sky for closing shot.

## Run results (headless automation)
- Completed 10-frame mob-proximity flavored sweep; captured state snapshots showing increased mobs nearby (20 -> 26) by tick 5.
- Feeling: the run felt brisk and readable; the state jump gave a nice “live world” cue for narration.
- No command errors; only host Vulkan validation warning in game log.
